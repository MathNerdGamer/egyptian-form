# Egyptian Form

In the article titled "An Algebraic Algorithm for the Representation Problems of the Ahmes Papyrus," by Solomon W. Golomb, *American Mathematical Monthly*, Vol. 69, 1962, an algorithm was described which gives the so-called **Egyptian form** for a fraction.

**Definition** An *Egyptian form* for a fraction p/q with integers 0 < p < q is a sum of reciprocals of distinct positive integers ```math n_{1},\ldots,n_{k} ``` such that
```math
\frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{n_{1}} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n_{k}}.
```
